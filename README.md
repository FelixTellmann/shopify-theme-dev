**Please note**: This framework is in active development. I'm keeping it in a cycle of 0.0.x releases at the moment to indicate that itâ€™s not even ready for its 0.1.0. Active work is being done on documentation and features, and APIs should not necessarily be considered stable. At the same time, it is more than a toy project or proof of concept, and I am actively using it for my own application development.

## S6 - Shopify Theme Development kit


This runs a local FTP server (on localhost) that will communicate with Shopify over HTTP API and allows you to upload/download/edit your theme files and assets using your favorite FTP client.

Note: this tool is built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and is installed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.org) so make sure to have Node installed. I have tested this on Mac and Windows. 

### Installation:

    npm install shopify-theme-dev

Setting up env variables:
```dotenv
SHOPIFY_CMS_SHOP
SHOPIFY_CMS_STOREFRONT_DIGEST
SHOPIFY_CMS_ACCESS_TOKEN
SHOPIFY_CMS_THEME_ID
SHOPIFY_CMS_FOLDER
```


### Usage:

    `shopify-typed-settings`
